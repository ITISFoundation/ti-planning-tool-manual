- Under ```Studies```, existing Plans (own Plans, or plans that have been shared by other users) can be accessed and managed, and new Plans can be [created](docs/plan/create_new_plan.md). 
- Under ```Data```, the existing data can be managed and downloaded (see [Data](/docs/platform_introduction/data.md)).

In addition, buttons on the top right provide access to this user manual, switching between a dark and a light theme, and a menu with the following entries:
- _**Preferences**_: Access to **Profile**, **_Security_**, **_API_**, **_UI_**, **_Confirmations_**, **_Tag_**, and **_Organization_** settings (see the [o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC User Manual](https://docs.osparc.io/#/) for detailed information)
- _**Clusters**_: Currently inactive for default users.
- _**Quick Start**_: A short **Quick Start** guide, which is also displayed the first time the TI Planning Tool is accessed.
- _**License**_: Information about the TI Planning Tool license, as well as the licenses of the underlying technologies.
- _**About**_: List of **Front-end** and **Back-end** technologies employed by the TI Planning Tool
- _**Logout**_: Logging out from the **TI Planning Tool**
