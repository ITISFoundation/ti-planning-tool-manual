- Under ```Studies```, existing Plans (own Plans, or plans that have been shared by other users) can be accessed (3.) and managed (4.), and new Plans can be [created](docs/plan/create_new_plan.md).
- Under ```Data```, the existing data can be managed and downloaded (see [Data](/docs/platform_introduction/data.md)).

In addition, buttons on the top right provide access to notifications, various support material/contact options, and a menu (5.) with the following entries:

- _**My Account**_: Information about user, option to change password or delete account. Usage overview is also accessible.
- _**Billing Center**_: Access to **Credit Accounts**, **Payment Methods**, **Transactions** and **Usage**.
- _**Preferences**_: Access to **General Settings**, **Confirmation Settings** and  **Create/Edit Tags**.
- **_Organizations_** group of users who can share studies. (see the [o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC User Manual](https://docs.osparc.io/#/) for detailed information)
- _**Light/Dark Theme**_: A short **Quick Start** guide, which is also displayed the first time the TI Planning Tool is accessed.
- _**About oSPARC**_: List of **Front-end** and **Back-end** technologies employed by the TI Planning Tool
- _**License**_: Information about the TI Planning Tool license, as well as the licenses of the underlying technologies.
- _**Log out**_: Logging out from the **TI Planning Tool**

The user access more functionality such as **_Overview_**, **Study Files**, **Sharing**, and **_Services Updates_** (3.) through the three-dot menu (1.) icon (see the [o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC User Manual](https://docs.osparc.io/#/) for information on these functionalities as well as the locking states). 
If Services within a Plan need updating, the small circular arrow sign will appear in the bottom right corner (2.) of the Plan
on the **Dashboard**. Clicking this icon will bring you directly to the update menu where you see the current and newest available
versions of each Service and where you can update them either individually or all together (4.).

It is always possible to return to the _**Dashboard**_ by clicking the ```Dashboard``` button on the top left, which automatically saves the state of the currently opened plan.
