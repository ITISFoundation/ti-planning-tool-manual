When changing to this section, you are presented with the filesystem of your account on 
o²S²PARC. You can navigate, delete, and download files, such as logs or the input/output data of Services. Two principal views are available: an icon and a list view - the latter provides additional information about the file size and the last modification date. Occasionally, it can be necessary to press the ```Reload``` button, to refresh the filesystem tree.

For more Information, see the [o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC User Manual](https://docs.osparc.io/#/).
