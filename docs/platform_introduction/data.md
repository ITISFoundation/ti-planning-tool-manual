When changing to this section, you are presented with the file system of the selected Study (1.). By selecting a certain directory, the files within that folder will be displayed in the area to the right (2.). You can download files (3.), such as logs or the input/output data of Services. Two principal views are available: an icon and a list view - the latter provides additional information about the file size and the last modification date. Occasionally, it can be necessary to click the ```Reload``` button to refresh the file system tree.
