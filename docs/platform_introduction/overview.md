The Landing Page, which currently serves primarily for user authentication. Two-factor authentication is required:
- a user name (email address) and password
- an SMS is sent to your mobile number that supplies the required one-time 4-digit pin

An account can be requested and created directly through the _**Create Account**_ link on the Landing Page, by providing an email address and setting a password. If the user cannot remember the password of an existing account, it can be reset through the _**Create Account**_ link.
