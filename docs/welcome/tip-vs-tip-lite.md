# What is the difference between TIP and TIP lite?

[TIP](https://tip.science) and [TIP Lite](https://tip-lite.science) are both tools for planning temporal interference brain stimulation, but with some important distinctions:

Full TIP Features:

- Multiple TI modes: **Classic TI**, **multi-channel TI** (up to 8 channels), and **phase-modulation TI**
- Five pre-computed anatomical models
- Personalized anatomical models with automated landmark detection
- SuMo optimizer with Gaussian process modeling and multi-objective genetic algorithms
- Comprehensive exposure analysis using embedded [Sim4Life](https://sim4life.swiss) postprocessing
- Report generation capabilities
- Advanced optimization for all TI modes

TIP Lite Features:

- **Classic TI** mode only
- Two anatomical models: MIDA anisotropic and Mouse
- Basic exposure visualization (full analysis disabled)
- No report generation

TIP Lite remains free to use without credit card information. It provides essential TI planning capabilities and is ideal for users new to TI or with basic planning needs.

Upgrading to Full TIP:

- Users can request access to the full version of TIP to access all features, including personalized planning, advanced TI modes, and comprehensive analysis tools.
