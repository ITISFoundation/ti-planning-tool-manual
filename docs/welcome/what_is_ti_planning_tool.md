# Why offer a TI Planning Tool?

Temporal interference stimulation (TIS) [[5]](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/ti-planning-tool-manual/blob/main/docs/background/references.md) has recently generated significant interest and stimulated numerous animal and human studies due to its potential to selectively stimulate deep-seated brain regions without activating overlying structures. 

At ITâ€™IS Foundation, we are dedicated to supporting innovative, safe, and effective therapies through cutting-edge computational life sciences. In response to overwhelming requests for our computational modeling tools and expertise to create optimized protocols, we have developed two online simulation platforms:
 - [TIP](https://tip.science): A powerful and feature-rich environment offered primarily to our research partners and members of the Early Adopter Program.
 - [TIP.lite](https://tip-lite.science): A streamlined version of TIP with both practical and educational value, open to students and researchers.

Both TIP platforms are based on our [o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC](https://osparc.io/) technology and are designed to support neuroscientists and brain stimulation experts in optimizing electrode placement and exposure conditions for targeted TIS

## Key Features
 - Advanced Modeling: Utilize state-of-the-art computational tools for precise TIS planning.
 - User-Friendly Interface: Designed for researchers who may not be modeling experts.
 - Customization: Tailor stimulation protocols to specific research needs.
 - Educational Value: TIP.lite serves as a learning tool for students and early-career researchers.

## Benefits
 - Empowerment: Enables individual researchers to conduct sophisticated TIS planning without extensive modeling expertise.
 - Efficiency: Streamlines the process of creating optimized TIS protocols.
 - Accessibility: Provides access to advanced computational tools through user-friendly online platforms.
 - Collaboration: Facilitates partnership between IT'IS Foundation and the research community.

By offering these TI Planning Tools, we aim to accelerate research in the field of temporal interference stimulation and contribute to the development of innovative brain stimulation therapies.
