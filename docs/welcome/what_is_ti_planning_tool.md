## Why offer a TI Planning Tool?

Temporal interference stimulation (TIS) [[5]](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/ti-planning-tool-manual/blob/main/docs/background/references.md) and its potential to selectively stimulate deep-seated brain regions without activating overlaying structures has recently generated huge interest and stimulated a large number of animal and human studies. 

At IT’IS Foundation, we are committed to supporting innovative, safe, and effective therapies through leading-edge computational life sciences. We have found ourselves overwhelmed with requests to use our computational modeling tools and expertise to create optimized protocols. Our solution to empower individual researchers that might not be modeling experts themselves now comes in the form of TIP V1.0. TIP – accessible fully online and based on our [o<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>PARC](https://osparc.io/) technology – supports neuroscientists and brain stimulation experts in the design of optimized electrode placement and exposure conditions for targeted TIS.
