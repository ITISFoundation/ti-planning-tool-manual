# Post Processing

## Overview

The Post Processing stage allows you to sort, visualize and analyze the optimizers results of your electrode selection. 
It is separated in two main sections. 

* **Analysis** <br/>

    In the first half of the **Analysis** section, a part of the optimizers output is presented in a sortable table.
    Different setups can be compared and sorted using the three main metrics: Strength, Selectivity and Collateral. 
    The second half is used for visualization of the fields in 2D, 3D and waveforms.

* **Report** <br/>
    In this section, a more detailed overview over the metrics is given, both for high frequency (HF) and temporal 
    interference (TI) exposure. Cumulative histograms show the behaviour in/out of the target and line plots the 
    development of the metrics over the channel weight range.
