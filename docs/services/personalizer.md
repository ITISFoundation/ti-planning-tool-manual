## Images Processing

**_Summary_**:

As the first step for personalization, provide the data via the file picker: either a T1-weighted MRI for an isotropic model or a zipped file containing T1, DTI, bval, and bvec files for an anisotropic model. After uploading, specify the electrode geometry and whether to register a detailed atlas to the brain; click Start to generate the anatomical model.

----

As the initial step for personalization, the user is asked to provide, in the file picker, the data you want to work with. Here you have two options: building an isotropic model which only requires a T1-weighted MR image, or an anisotropic model which requires a DTI with bval & bvac files on top of the T1. If the anisotropic option is desired, all four files should be zipped together.

1. **Data Instructions**
   A brief summary of what files and formates are needed, image quality recommendations and a reminder to annonymize the data before uploading.

2. **Upload Option 1**
   Select a file using the file explorer by clicking on ```Select File``` or directly drag and drop the the data to the designated area.

3. **Upload Option 2**
   If the data is already available online somewhere (eg. Google Drive or Dropbox), given that the sharing is set to public, the link can be provided.

4. **Upload Option 3**
   In case data already uploaded to TIP in a different study shall be reused, it can be selected from TIP's data explorer.

Once uploaded, the user can specify the geometry of the electrode, and if the head should be registered to the ICBM_152 atlas for cortical structures. By clicking start, the anatomical model is generated. Computational time is approximated to be ~1h, and can increase to ~2.5h if cortical atlas registration is selected. The computation is done when a tick-icon appears on the previously pushed start button. The user can go to the next step by pressing the arrow on the right.

The interface has the following elements:

1. **Select Electroder Radius**

   The radius of the cylindrical electrodes is selected here. This can only be changes as long as no simulations have been started in [Step 4: EM Simulations](/docs/services/simulator.md).

2. **Select Atlas to Register**

   By defailt, the model prediction already contains a couple of targets. These are listed in the logger (4) in the image above. If these are sufficient, you can leave this setting at ```None```.
   If not, a detailed atlas can be registered to the brain. Select the according option. Since this is a multi-select list, please make sure that ```None``` is not selected together with the atlas to register, because the registration will always be skipped if ```None``` is selected.

3. **Progress Overview**

   Shows the progress of each individual step in the model generation. ```10-10``` will only be done if the [Step 2: Fiducials Placement](/docs/services/fiducials_placement.md) already has been done.

4. **Logging**

   Provides some information about this step at start-up and will display information and eventual errors during runtime.

You can now click to the arrow on the right side of the browser to move to [Step 2: Fiducials Placement](/docs/services/fiducials_placement.md).
