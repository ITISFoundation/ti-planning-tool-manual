S4L Post Processing

This last step is a light version of Sim4Life. It provides a lot of powerful tools to analyse simulation results 
in even further detail than the **Post Processing** stage, in case you would like to investigate certain setup options
even closer. To use it, the .cache file of the setup of interest needs to be generated in the **Post Processing** service's
**Analysis** tab using the ```Export to S4L``` Button. Once the pipeline detects a .cache file, it will be loaded into
Sim4Life web's workbench automatically. Now, all of Sim4Life's analysis capabilities are available to you.
