## Interactive exposure exploration

_In addition to the predefined exposure visualizations of the second step, free exploration using the full visualization and analysis power of Sim4Life:web (ZMT Zurich MedTech AG) [add link here] is optionally possible, which includes volume rendering, streamline extraction, masking, projecting, calculation of derived quantities, etc._

To use it, the .cache file of the setup of interest needs to be generated in the **Post Processing** service's
**Analysis** tab using the ```Export to S4L``` Button. Once the pipeline detects a .cache file, it will be loaded into
Sim4Life web's workbench automatically. Now, all of Sim4Life's analysis capabilities are available to you.
