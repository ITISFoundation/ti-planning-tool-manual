## Interactive Exposure Exploration

**_Summary_**:

_In addition to the predefined exposure visualizations of the second step, free exploration using the full visualization and analysis power of Sim4Life:web (ZMT Zurich MedTech AG) [add link here] is optionally possible which includes volume rendering, streamline extraction, masking, projecting, calculation of derived quantities, etc._

----


To perform an interactive exposure analysis, you need to generate the .cache file of the setup of interest by clicking the ```Export to S4L``` as explained in [**Analysis**](/docs/services/post_processing.md). Once the pipeline detects a .cache file, it will be loaded into Sim4Life web's workbench automatically. Now, all of Sim4Life's analysis capabilities are available to you.
