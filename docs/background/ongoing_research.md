## Ongoing Research, Upcoming Functionality 

In the near future, the library of precomputed fields will be broadened (more head models, other species, and different electrode shapes).

More functionality will be added to the TI Planning tool over time, as existing research code matures:
- Personalization: A pipeline has been developed [[7]](/docs/background/references.md) that permits personalized modeling based on subject image data. This largely automatized pipeline involves AI-based model generation, electrode placement, and execution of EM simulations, before continuing with the steps of the current TI planning.
- Electrode Shape and Placement Customization: As TI planning tool functionality going beyond the use of precomputed fields becomes available, additional functionality based on the web version of Sim4Life will be added that permits the used CAD modeling to customize electrode shape and placement.
- Neural Response Modeling: Research on coupling exposure modeling with (personalized) modeling of the resulting impact on brain network activity is currently ongoing.

We also plan to establish a repository of TIS protocols generated by different research groups. And much more. Watch out for forthcoming TIP versions!
