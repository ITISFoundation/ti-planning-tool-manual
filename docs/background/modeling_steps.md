The planning process is presented to the user in three successive steps.
- In a first step, the relevant species, stimulation target, and potential electrode locations (currently required to narrow down the huge exposure configuration search space) are selected.
- Based on extensive sweeping/optimization, a series of highly performing exposure parameters are proposed for the user to interactively explore, using predefined quantification metrics and visualizations. Identified conditions-of-interest can be documented and added to a report.
- Finally, and optionally, exposure conditions-of-interest can be visualized and analyzed freely, using the web-version of the Sim4Life (ZMT Zurich MedTech AG) computational life sciences platform.

The principal computational steps are i) the electromagnetic modeling and ii) the exploration of the exposure condition space, for which additional background is provided in the next sections.
