In view of the above-mentioned impossibility of simultaneously optimizing all exposure quality metrics M1–3, a Pareto multi-goal optimization approach is chosen, wherein an entire Pareto front of ‘optimal’ configurations is identified, for all possible electrode configurations from the user-specified selection (a 1:1 current ratio between the two channels is assumed at this point). Here ‘optimal’ has the meaning that no configuration is known that improves on quality metrics, without degrading performance with regard to one or multiple other metrics.
From this front of solutions, a specific solution can either be chosen by focusing on a single metric, or by assigning weights to the three metrics. Both is possible in the second step of the planning workflow. Furthermore, the current ratio can be varied in this step, supported by graphs that show the current-ratiodependence of M1–3. The user is also free to interactively vary other parameters of the exposure configuration (e.g., electrode selection).
