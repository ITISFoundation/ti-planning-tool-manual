The first version of the planning software is based on precomputed fields. These fields were determined using the Sim4Life software, along with detailed anatomical models, such as the MIDA model [1], the Virtual Population (ViP; [2]), and the ViZOO [3]. The simulations are performed using the ohmic-current-dominated electro-quasistatic simulator that solves the equation ∇σ∇ϕ = 0 (σ: electric conductivity, ϕ: electric potential – the E-field is obtained as E = −∇ϕ; this equation is applicable, as the wavelength is much larger than the head size and displacement currents are negligible compared to ohmic currents at the relevant frequencies). Tissue properties were assigned according to [4], and careful solver convergence and grid refinement analyses were
carried out.
