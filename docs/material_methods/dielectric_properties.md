**Dielectric Tissue and Material Properties**

Unless stated otherwise, the tissue in the MIDA model were considered homogeneous and isotropic and their electric conductivity values were assigned according to the [IT'IS Low Frequency (LF) Conductivity Database V4.1](<https://itis.swiss/virtual-population/tissue-properties/database/low-frequency-conductivity/>) [Hasgall2018]. 

As all electrodes were treated as boundary conditions (see [Boundary Conditions](docs/material_methods/boundary_cond.md)), no material properties had to be assigned.Â
