All the tissue in the MIDA model were considered homogeneous and isotropic, with electric conductivity values assigned 
according to the Low Frequency (LF) Conductivity IT'IS Database [Hasgall2018] 
V4.1. (<https://itis.swiss/virtual-population/tissue-properties/database/low-frequency-conductivity/>). 
All electrodes were considered active in order to use the superposition principle to compute electrode-configuration 
specific electric field distributions, therefore no material properties were assigned to the 
electrodes.[[AC1]](file:///C:/Users/steiner/Downloads/Materials%20and%20Methods.docx#_msocom_1)

 the limitations of this model: no electrode-tissue-interface considered, etc.
