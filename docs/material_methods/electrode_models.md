Simplified models of cylindrical electrodes were created in Sim4life using parameterized elemental geometries with 
variable contact surface and height, and placed on the skin of the MIDA anatomical model with the centers and the 
coordinates of the 10-10 International EEG Electrode System identified on the MIDA head model. This electrode reference 
system was created identifying the 4 fiducial points (nasion, inion and pre-auricular points), and using geodetic lines
identified on the skin's surface.
