### Electrode Shapes and Placement

TIP is designed, such that it supports different electrode shapes and montages. While the initial release uses a fixed electrode size and arrangement, more will be provided over time. The following list provides additional information about the supported electrode configurations:

* Cylindrically shaped electrodes with a parameterized diameter (default diameter: xxx mm), were created in Sim4life using constructive geometry. They were placed on the skin of the MIDA anatomical model such that their centers coincide with the 10-10 International EEG Electrode System of the head model. For that purpose, the four required fiducial points (nasion, inion, and pre-auricular points) were demarked and used to draw geodetic lines on the skin's surface, which in turn are used to identify the 10-10 system locations.
