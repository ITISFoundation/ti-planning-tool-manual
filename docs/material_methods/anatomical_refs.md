The MIDA head model [Iacono2015], developed by the IT'IS Foundation in collaboration with the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), was used as center of the electromagnetic (EM) simulations. The model is derived combining
multiple MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) modality images (morphological T1- and T2-weighted images, and arterial spin 
labelling (ASL) for imaging the vascularity), and non-rigidly registered diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data which allows 
inhomogeneous, anisotropic material property distributions to be assigned to neural tissues. The model was acquired with 
a spatial resolution of xxmm, and consists of 115 distinct tissues. The model includes as well a detailed segmentation 
of the inner brain structures, including brainsteam, hippocampus and amygdala.
