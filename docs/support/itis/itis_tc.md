End User Licence Terms

Version: September 2022


1. Scope | General

1.1 These End User Licence Terms (the “Terms”) apply between Foundation for Research on Information Technologies in Society (“IT’IS”) and the users of IT’IS’s TI Plan (the “Software”) ( the “End User”) and shall form an integral part of any agreement between IT’IS and End User, whether entered into by execution of registration forms or other registration documents by IT’IS and End User, by completion of any click-through or other online process, by email correspondence or in any other form (the “Agreement”).
1.2 IT’IS shall provide the Software to End User free of charge as software as a service in accordance with the Agreement. The Software is provided solely as software as a service, i. e., for browser-supported and Internet-based use via End User’s end devices. IT’IS may, at its sole discretion, subcontract any or all of its obligations under these Terms and any Agreement to third parties.
1.3 Specifications of the Software are included in the current user manual for the Software (the “Manual”). Any other product information sent to End User, if any, such as marketing material, product descriptions, product roadmaps and the like, shall be for informational purposes only and shall not constitute binding declarations by IT’IS.
1.4 The version of these Terms which is applicable at the time concerned shall also apply to all future Agreements between End User and IT’IS without IT’IS being required to refer to these Terms in each individual case. These Terms shall be deemed to be confirmed by End User at the latest when IT’IS grants access to the Software.
1.5 These Terms shall apply exclusively. Any terms and conditions of End User which deviate from, conflict with or supplement these Terms are explicitly waived.

2.1 In order to be able to use the Software in accordance with these Terms, End User shall create a dedicated user account on IT’IS’s website (the “End User Account”) 
2.2 IT’IS may carry out necessary updates and upgrades to the Software in order to improve the usability, security or stability of the Software or to extend its features or to ensure its compliance with statutory requirements. Updates and upgrades to the Software shall be provided at IT’IS’s sole discretion.
2.3 IT’IS strives to offer constant availability of the Software but cannot warrant uninterrupted availability thereof.

The Software does not provide binding results and is not a substitute for the expert End User's own calculations of electrode placement and stimulation conditions for targeting deep brain regions. The Software is only intended to assist the expert End User in his/her own calculations. Therefore, the expert End User shall always ascertain the Software's results by doing his/her own calculations. DO NOT ACT SOLELY ON THE RESULTS OF THE SOFTWARE. The expert End User uses the Software and its results at his/her own risk. As a consequence, IT'IS does not give any representations and warranties for the Software and the liability of IT'IS in connection with the Software and its use and application is excluded to the full extent possible under the applicable law. IT'IS is not liable for any damages (including without limitation consequential, incidental, direct, indirect, special or punitive damages, damages for loss of profits, loss of use, business interruption, loss of information or data, or pecuniary loss) resulting from the use of or reliance on the Software. In particular, IT'IS Foundation is not responsible for (a) the correctness, completeness, integrity and accuracy of any data calculated by the Software, (b) any conclusions drawn by the End User or any third party from any simulation, calculation, modelling or other process or operation executed by the Software or by End User using the Software, (c) the technical, scientific, legal and commercial feasibility of any project, product and undertaking of the End User or any third party, and (d) the economic and financial viability of any project, product and undertaking of the End User or any third party.

17.2 Should any provision of these Terms be or become ineffective or invalid in whole or in part, the effectiveness and validity of the other provisions of these Terms shall not be affected. Such ineffective or invalid provision shall be replaced by a provision which comes as close as legally possible to what IT’IS and End User would have agreed, pursuant to the meaning and purpose of the original provision and of these Terms if they had recognised the ineffectiveness or invalidity of the original provision.
