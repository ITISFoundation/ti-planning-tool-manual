# Release Notes

## TIP 4.0

### Release Date: 05.06.2025

TIP V4.0 brings intelligent automation, advanced optimization, and a streamlined user experience—delivering improved stimulation outcomes with less effort and greater speed.

### Selected New Features

- **Automated Personalization**: Neural network-based automatic identification and placement of anatomical landmarks for the EEG 10-10 system, eliminating the need for manual fiducial point placement.
- **Smart Optimization with SuMo**: New surrogate-modeling-based optimizer (SuMo) that combines Gaussian process modeling with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to systematically explore the solution space and provide Pareto-optimal solutions.
- **Enhanced Speed and Accuracy**: Optimization runs complete in half the time compared to TIP V3.0 with improved results, leveraging parallel processing to reduce wait times.
- **Streamlined User Workflow**: Simplified protocol design flow with intelligent automation and visualization upgrades, eliminating the electrode selector and sweep steps.

TIP V4.0 also includes many smaller features and general improvements in the presented information content and usability, as well as bug fixes.

## TIP V3.0

### Release Date: 24.09.2024

TIP V3.0 now includes the possibility of personalized modeling.

### Selected New Features

- **Personalized Stimulation Modeling**: Users can now upload a subject’s own anatomical data (T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and, optionally, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data) for personalized TI stimulation assessment, planning, and optimization. This feature allows for superior stimulation protocols thanks to improved modeling realism and prediction accuracy.
- **Enhanced Target Selection**: Users can register a detailed brain atlas at the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) to benefit from an increased number of potential target regions for stimulation optimization.
- **Parallelized Electromagnetic (EM) Simulations**: Leveraging AWS resources, low-frequency EM simulations are set up for individual electrodes and executed in parallel, speeding up the overall process.

TIP V3.0 also includes many smaller features and general improvements in the presented information content and usability, as well as bug fixes.
