## Create a New Plan

The setup of new TI Plan can easily be initiated by clicking on the large ```New Plan``` icon on the ```Dashboard```.

Three different kinds of planning studies can be initialized, which correspond to the [three modes](/docs/background/modes.md): _classic TI_, _multi-channel TI_, and _phase-modulation TI_.

Allow for some time for the study initiation. Once the study is ready, you will have access to the different planning steps and their views (note: some [TI modes](/docs/background/modes.md) only have two steps):
* [Step 1: Setup](/docs/services/electrode_selector.md)
* [Step 2: Optimal Configuration Identification](/docs/services/post_processing.md)
* [Step 3: Exposure Analysis](/docs/services/s4l_post_processing.md)
